** HV-MAPS: High Voltage Monolithic Active Pixel sensors
   MAPS is a pixel sensors concept which combines front-end electronics with sensitive material on one chip.
   Three parts on one chip (one die):

*** Characteristics
    - HV: 50-60V
    - Depletion thickness: 10 um
    - Primary electron-holes: 700
    - Pixel size: $$80\times80{\mu}m^2\$$
*** TODO MuPix (real prototype chip)
**** Structure Layout:
    - Sensor
    - Analog electronic circuit
    - Digital electronic circuit
    - Readout control circuit
    - Fast data serializer circuit
**** Timestamp generation on chip
     - Gray counter
** Electronic chain

*** Front-end (in sensor chip, integrated within pixel)              :OnChip:
**** AC-coupling
**** Charge-Sensitive Amplifier
*** TODO Digital-part (also in sensor chip, located on one side of the chip) :Undecided:OnChip:
**** Second amplifer (Optional)
**** CR-RC Shaping (shaping time: 1 us)
**** Discriminator
**** TODO Time-to-Digit (Timestamp generated)
     - accept external clock: 20/40 MHz. The clock is used to drive the gray counter for timestamp generation and the serilizer logic.
     - pixel address and timestamp
     - 8/10 bits serialization using LVDS
     - generate higher clock speed internally to improve timestamp accuracy: max. 10ns
*** DAQ
**** FPGA-Boards (TRBv3)
     TRBv3 is an abbreviation of "General Purpose Trigger and Readout Boardâ€”version 3".
     And the TRB-family (according to TRB website: [[http://trb.gsi.de/)]] contains a versatile FPGA-platform, TDC-in-FPGA technology with 10ps precision, front-end electronics and a complete set of data acquisition and control software.
     For LMD, TRBv3 is used as a versatile FPGA-platform with following functions:
     - receive the incoming serial data stream from the HV-MAPS
     - perform a clock recovery
     - de-serialize the data stream
     - compatible with SODA and correlate the SODA time with the encoded data time.
     
**** PANDA DAQ Infrastructure
***** SODAnet: Clock distribution, synchronization, reset
      SODA is an abbreviation of "Synchronization Of Data Acquisition".
***** PANDA Concentrator
***** PANDA event builder
***** PANDA computing farm
